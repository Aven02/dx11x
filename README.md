# DirectX 11 X-file Viewer

This example shows how to implement X-file skinning animation without D3DX.

## Compiling

* Visual Studio 2013 required.
* No need to install DirectX SDK.
* DIRECTXTEX_DIR environment variable points to the location of the DirectXTex library. Please make sure that compile option of two projects match. (I prefer Multi-threaded (/MT) oprion to solve dependencies)
